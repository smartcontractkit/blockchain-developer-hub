For smart-contract coding, you should choose the language you feel most comfortable with. Use this reference table to
get started.

## Security

As is the `case` with any software workflow, you must ensure that your smart contracts are tested thoroughly in both
development and test environments (testnets), but in addition, you must be aware of common attack types and the
solutions and best practices that can be used to mitigate attacks and help you deploy secure smart contracts.

In addition to the tools listed in the ecosystem map, it‚Äôs important to be familiar with the most common attack types.
These include;

- Re-entrancy
- Source of randomness
- Oracle manipulation
  - Test nested

Get familiar with these attacks and read more at the
[Consensys Smart Contract Known Attacks](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/attacks/) page.

## Auditing

While security starts with the first line of code written by developers, having a third party audit your smart contracts
prior to shipping them is always a good idea. While this is not a replacement for development best practices, it has
become a must before deploying to a mainnet.

Some of the most popular auditing teams include

- [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/security-audits/)
- [Consensys Diligence](https://consensys.net/diligence/)
- [Runtime Verification](https://runtimeverification.com/smartcontract/)
- [Certora](https://www.certora.com/)
- [Halborn](https://halborn.com/)
