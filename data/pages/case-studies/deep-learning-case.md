## Introduction

A smart contract is a tamper-proof program that runs on a blockchain network when certain predefined conditions are met.

Each smart contract consists of code specifying predetermined conditions that, when met, trigger outcomes. By running on
a decentralized blockchain instead of a centralized server, smart contracts allow multiple parties to come to a shared
result in a transparent, timely, and tamper-proof manner. ‍ Smart contracts are a powerful infrastructure tool for
automation because they are not controlled by a central administrator and, as a result, aren’t vulnerable to single
points of failure.
