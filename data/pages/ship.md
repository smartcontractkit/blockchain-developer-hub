## Ship overview - Hello from MD

Don't be spooked by the technobabble that people use to describe "blockchain." A blockchain is just a database. It isn't
a particularly sophisticated one, either - you could create it in a spreadsheet with minimal effort. There are some
peculiarities with these databases. The first is that blockchains are append-only. That means that you can only add
information - you can't just click on a cell and delete stuff that you've already added, or change it in any way. The
second is that each entry (called a block) in the database is cryptographically linked to the last entry. In plain
English, each new entry must contain a sort of digital fingerprint (hash) of the last one.

> And that's it! Since each fingerprint points back to the last one, you end up with a chain of blocks. Or - as the cool
> kids like to call it - a blockchain.

### How blockchain works

And that's it! Since each fingerprint points back to the last one, you end up with a chain of blocks. Or - as the cool
kids like to call it - a blockchain. A blockchain is immutable: if you change a block, it changes the fingerprint. And
since that fingerprint is included in the next block, the next block is changed too. And since that block's
fingerprint... well, you get the idea. You end up with a domino effect where any change becomes evident. You can't alter
any information without everyone noticing.

## Benefits of a blockchain

1. Users are rewarded for the value they provide and can become co-owners in the products they use.
2. Products can harness the intelligence of the crowd.
3. Users are increasingly able to influence the scope of the product, and even participate in the product development.
4. Organisations can increase transparency and meritocracy through public on-chain identities and reputation.
