## Why blockchain?

Blockchain developers command some of the highest salaries in the software development industry. Blockchain
entrepreneurs have ready access to both venture capital and grants, however, its true genius is the ability to
revolutionize agreements, democratize business on the internet, and redefine the need of trust itself.

The brilliance of blockchain lies in its decentralized nature; this is one database that doesn't exist in a central
location, as legacy databases do. The blockchain is shared by many computers, which makes transactions easy to verify
and almost impossible for any one user to change information in nefarious ways.

By decentralizing data, we longer rely on trust in order to carry out transactions. For example, a conventional
centralized institution, such as a bank, may tell its customers that they can withdraw their money at any time, but if
all customers decided to do so at the same time, the bank would be unable to comply with such a request. In contrast, if
a certain number of tokens are assigned to specific addresses in the blockchain, they could all action their tokens at
the same time, and the blockchain will happily comply. This is because blockchain is based on cryptography and public
distributed ledgers.

## Why is it so important?

The nature of blockchain allows for trustless systems to be built on top of it. Users don't rely on a centralized group
of people, such as a bank, to make decisions and allow transactions to flow through. Because the system is
decentralized, users know that transactions will never be denied for non-custodial reasons.

This decentralization enables use-cases that were previously impossible, such as parametric insurance, decentralized
finance, and decentralized organizations (DAOs), among a few. This allows developers to build products that provide
immediate value without having to go through a bureaucratic process of applications, approvals, and general red tape.

Why should I learn it?

Blockchain development is underway at most companies, even if just at early research stages. A recent
[PWC study](https://theblockchainacademy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/04/2021-Global-Blockchain-Employment-Report.pdf)
shows that 77% of companies developing software are involved with blockchain in some capacity. This translates into high
demand for jobs in the sector. The same study shows an increased demand for blockchains developers of 6000% in 2020.
